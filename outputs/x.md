To design a simple neural network that models the linear function \(f(\mathbf{x}) = m\mathbf{x} + b\), we choose the weights and biases as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(\mathbf{w}_0 = [m, 0]^T\) and \(b_0 = [b, 0]^T\), which configure the input to the hidden layer. This setup ensures that the ReLU activation function (\(\sigma\)) operates on a linearly scaled and shifted version of \(\mathbf{x}\), directly mapping to \(m\mathbf{x} + b\) for the first neuron in the hidden layer, while effectively neutralizing the second neuron.
    \item The weights connecting the hidden layer to the output layer are chosen as \(\mathbf{w}_1 = [1, 0]^T\). This configuration aggregates the activated inputs to produce the desired linear output \(f(\mathbf{x}) = m\mathbf{x} + b\), utilizing only the first neuron's output in the hidden layer.
\end{itemize}
These selections for \(\mathbf{w}_0\), \(b_0\), and \(\mathbf{w}_1\) ensure that the neural network models the specified linear function with a ReLU (\(\text{ReLU}\)) activation function.

In self-attention mechanisms, attention weights \(\alpha_i\) cannot become infinitely large due to the normalization property of the softmax function, which ensures that the weights are distributed in the range \((0, 1)\). Since the exponential function, which is part of the softmax calculation, always produces positive values, the denominator in the attention weight calculation cannot be zero. This guarantees that the softmax function is well-defined and produces a valid probability distribution where the attention weights sum to 1.

Theoretically, \(\alpha_i\) cannot be exactly zero because the softmax function's exponential nature results in all weights being strictly positive. However, in practice, due to finite precision arithmetic used in computations, \(\alpha_i\) can be rounded to zero if it represents a value significantly smaller than the machine's precision can accurately capture. This occurs in the context of underflow, where numbers very close to zero are rounded down to zero by the computer's floating-point representation.

To summarize, \(\alpha_i\) is constrained to be within the range \((0, 1]\), with it being infinitely large forbidden by the softmax function's bounded output, and exactly zero theoretically impossible but practically feasible due to numerical precision limitations.

We affirm that it is theoretically possible to approximate the function $f(x) = x^2$ using a finite-dimensional neural network with ReLU activation functions ($\sigma(x) = \max(0, x)$) to any arbitrary precision $\varepsilon > 0$, according to the universal approximation theorem. This theorem states that a sufficiently large neural network with at least one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ within any desired degree of accuracy. For approximating $f(x) = x^2$, the procedure involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Partitioning the Input Space:} Segmenting the input domain into smaller intervals.
    \item \textbf{Initializing Weights and Biases:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $w_0$ and $b_0$, configure these parameters to activate specific neurons in the hidden layer over distinct segments of the input, facilitating the piecewise linear approximation.
        \item Adjust $w_1$ to appropriately scale and sum the outputs from the hidden neurons, mimicking the behavior of $f(x) = x^2$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increasing the Network Capacity:} Employing a large number of hidden neurons ($d$) to refine the approximation, particularly for achieving higher precision (smaller $\varepsilon$).
\end{enumerate}

Thus, while the approximation of $f(x) = x^2$ within any arbitrary error margin $\varepsilon$ is possible in theory, it requires meticulous configuration of the networkâ€™s weights and biases, alongside a potentially large number of hidden neurons, especially as $\varepsilon$ approaches zero.

To model the function \(f(\mathbf{x}) = m\mathbf{x} + b\) with a neural network using ReLU (\(\sigma\)) as the activation function, we select the weights and biases as follows:

1. For the input to the hidden layer transformation, we choose \( \mathbf{w}_0 = [1, 1]^T \) and \( b_0 = [0, 0]^T \). This ensures that the input is transformed linearly without modification by the ReLU activation since it will pass positive values unchanged.

2. For the hidden layer to output transformation, the weights are set to \( \mathbf{w}_1 = [m, 0]^T \), scaling the passed value from the ReLU activation back to the desired linear function scale.

Thus, the neural network configuration is \(\mathbf{w}_0 = [1, 1]^T\), \(b_0 = [0, 0]^T\), and \(\mathbf{w}_1 = [m, 0]^T\), which correctly models the linear function \(f(\mathbf{x}) = m\mathbf{x} + b\) for any input \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}\).

Given any \(\varepsilon > 0\), it is possible to construct fixed finite-dimensional vectors \(w_0, w_1, b_0\) such that \(|f(x) - x^2| = |w_1^T\sigma(w_0x + b_0) - x^2| < \varepsilon\) for \(x \in [0, 1]\), where \(\sigma = \text{ReLU}\). This capability rests on the fact that a neural network with ReLU activations can approximate any continuous function on a compact interval to any desired accuracy by employing piecewise linear functions.

To construct \(w_0, w_1, b_0\), one follows these steps:

1. **Divide \([0, 1]\) into subintervals**: The interval \([0, 1]\) is divided into a finite number of subintervals. The choice of the number of subintervals, and thus the value of \(d\), determines the approximation's granularity and accuracy.

2. **Configure ReLU Activations**: For each subinterval, a ReLU activation is configured to approximate a linear segment of \(x^2\). The parameters \(w_0\) and \(b_0\) define the slope and activation threshold of these linear segments, respectively.

3. **Set Aggregate Layer Weights**: The weights \(w_1\) are adjusted so that the combination of the activated ReLU units' outputs closely matches the function \(x^2\) across the entire interval.

4. **Optimization**: Although this procedure outlines an architectural setup, optimizing its parameters (\(w_0, w_1, b_0\)) to minimize the approximation error is typically done using numerical optimization techniques, ensuring that the error \(|f(x) - x^2|\) is less than \(\varepsilon\) for every \(x \in [0, 1]\).

In conclusion, the use of a sufficient number of subdivisions or hidden neurons, along with appropriate optimization, ensures that a neural network with a single hidden layer of ReLU activations can approximate \(x^2\) on the interval \([0, 1]\) to any specified precision \(\varepsilon > 0\).

Given a sequence of length \(n\) and matrices \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) each of size \(n \times d\), computing the self-attention involves calculating \(P = \text{softmax}(QK^T)\). If \(P\) has rank \(k\) and its Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is known, then the computation of self-attention can be optimized to \(O(nkd)\) time. This optimization arises from leveraging the SVD of \(P\), which is expressed as \(U\Sigma V^T\), where \(U\) and \(V\) are orthogonal matrices with dimensions fitting the involved spaces, and \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix of singular values. The core operation then becomes computing \(U\Sigma (\mathbb{1}_{k \times k}V)V = U\Sigma\), since \(V^TV = \mathbb{1}_{k \times k}\), where \(\mathbb{1}_{k \times k}\) denotes the \(k \times k\) identity matrix. The multiplication \(U\Sigma\) scales as \(O(nk)\) and since \(\Sigma\) is diagonal, its interaction with \(V\) (or effectively the identity operation) introduces a scaling factor of \(d\), leading to an overall complexity of \(O(nkd)\). This represents a significant computational advantage over direct calculation methods, particularly for large \(n\) where efficiency becomes critically important.

To demonstrate that the attention weights computed using the RBF kernel $\beta_i$ are equivalent to those computed using the dot product $\alpha_i$, given the conditions $\sigma = 1$ and $\lVert k_i \rVert = 1$ for all $i$, we begin with the expressions for $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$:

- Dot product-based similarity: $\alpha_i = \frac{\exp(k_i^T q)}{\sum_{j} \exp(k_j^T q)}$.
- RBF kernel-based similarity: $\beta_i = \frac{\exp(-\lVert q-k_i \rVert^2 / 2\sigma)}{\sum_{j} \exp(-\lVert q-k_j \rVert^2 / 2\sigma)}$.

For $\sigma = 1$, we express the norm squared in $\beta_i$ as $\lVert q-k_i \rVert^2 = \lVert q \rVert^2 - 2q^T k_i + \lVert k_i \rVert^2$. Given $\lVert k_i \rVert = 1$, this simplifies to:

$\exp(-\lVert q-k_i \rVert^2 / 2) = \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\lVert q \rVert^2 - 2q^T k_i + 1)) = \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\lVert q \rVert^2) * \exp(q^T k_i) * \exp(-\frac{1}{2})$.

Since $\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\lVert q \rVert^2)$ and $\exp(-\frac{1}{2})$ are constants and do not depend on $i$, they cancel out in the softmax computation, rendering $\beta_i$ equivalent to $\alpha_i$:

$\beta_i = \frac{\exp(q^T k_i)}{\sum_{j} \exp(q^T k_j)} = \alpha_i$.

Hence, under the conditions of $\sigma = 1$ and norm of keys equal to 1, the RBF kernel-based attention weights $\beta_i$ are equivalent to the dot product-based attention weights $\alpha_i$.
